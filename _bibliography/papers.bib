  abstract={The process of globalization and the development of new technologies have provided access to enormous amounts of data for processing. The rapid growth of these amounts will not slow down the near future. In fact, recent studies suggest that worldwide data creation will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025. This is ten times the amount of data produced in 2017 (Seagate, 2020). As a consequence of this, a plethora of new challenges in the field of statistics have arisen. In particular, novel mathematical methodologies are continuously being developed as a way to tackle the heterogeneous nature of the collected data. Similarly, distinct data collection procedures are restructured for the purpose of easing the process of data gathering. This growing body of statistical methodologies and collection procedures, in turn, lead to the emergence of the basic issue of provision of privacy in data collection and the establishment of fair methods for data analysis. Data privacy, as a concept, describes the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, legal and political issues surrounding them (Michael, 2013). Fairness, on the other hand, describes the concerns related to data analytics that can cause societal harm by preventing unbiased and consistent interpretation of the patterns within the data (Sokolovska & Kocarev, 2018).},

  abstract={Recent studies suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic
will induce drastic changes in the business models of
the insurance industry. However, despite an abundance of predictions, the literature still lacks empirical
investigations of the impact of the pandemic. In this
paper, we perform a first of a kind analysis and investigate the short‐run impact of COVID‐19 on the
activity in the insurance in one country—North Macedonia. By utilizing a seasonal autoregressive model,
we find that during the first half of 2020, the activity in
the insurance industry shrank by more than 10% to
what was expected. The total loss in the industry
amounted to approximately 8.2 million euros. This was
much less than the volume of reserves that the Insurance Supervision Agency made available as funds
for dealing with the potential crisis. In addition, the
pandemic induced changes in the insurance activity
structure—the share of motor vehicles class in the total
industry activity fell at the expense of the property
classes. Our results suggest that the insurance industry
in North Macedonia was well prepared to tackle the
consequences of the pandemic and that automatic
stabilizers had a major influence on weakening the
overall negative impact.},

  abstract={Ever since the dawn of merchanting, traders have sought ways to ease the cost oftransactions. The recent growth of information and communication technology provided awide range of solutions for international and national transactions by introducing e-commerce. As a result of this development, e-commerce recently emerged as a dominanttransaction activity with a significant impact on the national economies. In recent years thepotential of e-commerce has been widely discussed, with a particular focus on its effects ongreater economic welfare and prosperity. Yet, despite an abundance of studies that havebeen done on investigating the role of e-commerce in an economy, a thorough and detailedeconometric examination on its impact is still an underexplored avenue. This paper attemptsto bridge this gap by investigating the impact of volume of online transactions (e-commerce)and gross capital formation on economic growth, using panel data on 31 European countriescovering a 16 years’ period. The empirical panel data model is estimated by employing theGeneralized Method of Moments. The main findings from the study show that e-commerceand gross capital formation have positive and significant effects on GDP per capita basedon purchasing power parity, with e-commerce having a weaker development-enhancingeffect in comparison to gross capital formation. In addition, this paper proposes a fruitfuldiscussion on how to provide balance between the growth of e-commerce, the focus onimproving other aspects and generating optimal economic welfare and prosperity.

In this paper, we perform a detailed empirical study on the potential effects of firm profits and markups on government size and effectiveness. Using data on 30 European countries for a period of 17 years and an instrumental variables approach, we find that there exists a robust relationship between firm gains and the activity of the state, in the sense that higher firm profits reduce government size and effectiveness. Even in a group of developed countries, such as the European countries, firm power may affect state activity.},

  abstract={The initial period of vaccination shows strong heterogeneity between countries’ vaccinations rollout, both in the terms of the start of the vaccination process and in the dynamics of the number of people that are vaccinated. A predominant thesis for this observation is that a key determinant of the swift and extensive vaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantify different aspects of the state capacity: (i) the external capacity (measured through the soft power of the country) and (ii) the internal capacity (measured via the country’s government effectiveness) and provide an empirical test for their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in the initial period (up to 31st March 2021). By using data on 128 countries and a two-step Heckman approach, we find that the soft power is a robust determinant of whether a country has started with the vaccination process. In addition, the government effectiveness is a key factor that determines vaccine roll-out. Altogether, our findings are in line with the hypothesis that state capacity determines the observed heterogeneity between countries in the initial period of COVID-19 vaccines rollout. As such, they are a stark reminder for the need for transparent and fair global response regarding fair and equitable availability of vaccines to every country.},

extent of concentration in the income distribution, and income mobility, the feasibility of
an individual to change their position in the income rankings. For this purpose, we use the
properties of an established model for income growth that includes ‘resetting’ as a stabilizing
force to ensure stationary dynamics. We find that the dynamics of inequality is regimedependent: it may range from a strictly non-ergodic state where this phenomenon has an
increasing trend, up to a stable regime where inequality is steady and the system efficiently
mimics ergodicity. Mobility measures, conversely, are always stable over time, but suggest
that economies become less mobile in non-ergodic regimes. By fitting the model to empirical
data for the income share of the top earners in the USA, we provide evidence that the income
dynamics in this country is consistently in a regime in which non-ergodicity characterizes
inequality and immobility. Our results can serve as a simple rationale for the observed realworld income dynamics and as such aid in addressing non-ergodicity in various empirical
settings across the globe.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in great discrepancies in both infection and mortality rates between countries. Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude of social and economic criteria also influenced the extent to which these discrepancies appeared. Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic and health factors that correlate with the infection and mortality rates outcome of the pandemic. Here, we leverage Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate whether 28 variables, which describe a diverse set of health and socio-economic characteristics, correlate with the final number of infections and deaths during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. We show that only a few variables are able to robustly correlate with these outcomes. To understand the relationship between the potential correlates in explaining the infection and death rates, we create a Jointness Space. Using this space, we conclude that the extent to which each variable is able to provide a credible explanation for the COVID-19 infections/mortality outcome varies between countries because of their heterogeneous features.},

We also find that more developed economies were able to implement higher stimulus packages for the same relative level of primary balance. We believe that one of the factors affecting this outcome is that more of their government debt is held in domestic currency.},

  abstract={The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is interpreted as Brownian motion in a harmonic potential. This
Gaussian Markov process has a bounded variance and admits a stationary probability distribution,
in contrast to the standard Brownian motion. It also tends to a drift towards its mean function, and
such a process is called mean-reverting. Two examples of the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
are considered. In the first one, we study the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a comb model, as an
example of the harmonically bounded random motion in the topologically constrained geometry.
The main dynamical characteristics (as the first and the second moments) and the probability
density function are studied in the framework of both the Langevin stochastic equation and the
Fokker-Planck equation. The second example is devoted to the study of the effects of stochastic
resetting on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, including stochastic resetting in the comb geometry.
Here, the non-equilibrium stationary state is the main question in task, where the two divergent
forces, namely the resetting and the drift towards the mean, lead to compelling results both in the
case of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with resetting and its generalization on the two dimensional
comb structure.},

As such, it allows us to evaluate the changes in the innovation processes within the countries in a more profound way. Our findings suggest that there are no significant differences among the countries regarding the firms’ determinants to enter the innovation process. However, the effect of innovation output over labor productivity varies among economies: there is a positive relationship in the more developed economies compared to a negative or neutral relationship in the less developed. We use these results to speculate that the national innovation system in developing economies becomes more vulnerable in periods of the financial crisis.},

The three-dimensional comb is a comb inside a comb structure, consisting of backbones and fingers in the following geometrical correspondence x–backbone →y–fingers–backbone →z–fingers. Realisation of the O-U process on the three-dimensional comb leads to anomalous (non-Markovian) diffusion. This specific anomalous transport in the presence of resets results in non-equilibrium stationary states. Explicit analytical expressions for the mean values and the mean squared displacements along all three directions of the comb are obtained and verified numerically. The marginal probability density functions for each direction are obtained numerically by Monte Carlo simulation of a random transport described by a system of coupled Langevin equations for the comb geometry.},

the American dream, pertinent to the question Are we able to improve our income status during our working

thresholds: the current income and the desired income. Yet, our knowledge of these temporal properties of
income remains limited since we rely on estimates coming from transition matrices which simplify income
dynamics by aggregating the individual changes into quantiles and thus overlooking significant microscopic
variations. Here, we bridge this gap by employing First Passage Time concepts in a baseline stochastic process
with resetting used for modeling income dynamics and developing a framework that is able to cruciallydisaggregate the temporal properties of income to the level of an individual worker. We find analytically and
illustrate numerically that our framework is orthogonal to the transition matrix approach and leads to improved
and more granular estimates. Moreover, to facilitate potential empirical applications of the framework, we
introduce a statistical methodology, and showcase the application using the USA income dynamics data. These
results help to improve our understanding on the temporal properties of income in real economies and could
potentially provide a set of tools for designing policy interventions.},

Utilizing digital learning platforms, students were surveyed biweekly over the course of an academic year to determine collaboration patterns, resulting in a total of 14 surveys. Participants were asked to identify up to five peers with whom they collaborated most intensively during the preceding two weeks. Through the application of network analysis, the study identified central figures within the student community, analyzing their role in influencing academic performance and collaboration dynamics. An interesting and unexpected linear relationship was found between students’ grade point average (GPA) and both the nominations received and given. The findings reveal complex interactions between peer influence, collaboration, and academic success, shedding light on the potential importance of key collaborative figures within educational environments. The implications of this research hold promise for educators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to leverage peer-to-peer collaboration to enhance student engagement and success.},

  year={2024},
  abstract={The time irreversibility of a dynamical process refers to the phenomenon where its behaviour or statistical properties change when it is observed under a time-reversal operation, i.e., backwards in time and indicates the presence of an “arrow of time”. It is an important feature of both synthetic and real-world systems, as it represents a macroscopic property that describes the mechanisms driving the dynamics at a microscale level and that stems from non-linearities and the presence of non-conservative forces within them. While many alternatives have been proposed in recent decades to assess this feature in experimental time series, the evaluation of their performance is hindered by the lack of benchmark time series of known reversibility. To solve this problem, we here propose and evaluate the use of a geometric Brownian motion model with stochastic resetting. We specifically use synthetic time series generated with this model to evaluate eight irreversibility tests in terms of sensitivity with respect to several characteristics, including their degree of irreversibility and length. We show how tests yield at times contradictory results, including the false detection of irreversible dynamics in time-reversible systems with a frequency higher than expected by chance and how most of them detect a multi-scale irreversibility structure that is not present in the underlying data.},

  abstract={We study the effects of stochastic resetting on the reallocating geometric Brownian motion (RGBM), an established model for resource redistribution relevant to systems such as population dynamics, evolutionary processes,
economic activity, and even cosmology. The RGBM model is inherently nonstationary and non-ergodic, leading
to complex resource redistribution dynamics. By introducing stochastic resetting, which periodically returns
the system to a predetermined state, we examine how this mechanism modifies RGBM behavior. Our analysis
uncovers distinct long-term regimes determined by the interplay between the resetting rate, the strength of
resource redistribution, and standard geometric Brownian motion parameters: the drift and the noise amplitude.
Notably, we identify a critical resetting rate beyond which the self-averaging time becomes effectively infinite.
In this regime, the first two moments are stationary, indicating a stabilized distribution of an initially unstable,
mean-repulsive process. We demonstrate that optimal resetting can effectively balance growth and redistribution,
reducing inequality in the resource distribution. These findings help us understand better the management of
resource dynamics in uncertain environments.},

  pages={100430},
  abstract={Background: Peer influence is a significant determinant in shaping students’ academic performance, yet it isoften overlooked in traditional educational strategies. The ability to analyze peer influence and collaboration isan important piece in personalizing student educational experiences.Objective: This study aims to investigate how peer interactions can be used to predict students’ achievementlevels and create clusters based on these predictions. Building on these clusters, a novel AI-driven approachis introduced to personalize the learning experiences for each group, providing content aligned with students’predicted achievement levels and ensuring that students receive the right resources throughout their entireeducation.Methods: Bi-weekly surveys were conducted throughout the academic year with 45 students enrolled in acomputer science program, where students nominated up to five peers they collaborated with the most. Thedata were used to construct a weighted directed graph (also known as directed network), a type of directedgraph allowing multiple edges between the same nodes. Centrality measures were calculated from this directedgraph to classify students into low-achieving and high-achieving groups for two-class classification, and into low-achieving, high-achieving, and neutral groups for three-class classification. Generative AI was then utilized tocreate tailored learning scenarios for each student cluster. For high achievers, the scenario includes providingadvanced topics, critical-thinking quizzes and supplementary materials such as research papers and real-worldprojects. For low achievers, these materials include foundational course materials, multiple-choice quizzes andsupplementary materials like videos and step-by-step visualizations. The neutral group was given the option torequest specific learning materials and self-assessment quizzes on demand to address their individual learningneeds.Results: Eigenvector centrality of the peer collaboration network was identified as the best predictor of studentachievement. To assess students’ perceived acceptance of the proposed AI-driven personalization, a questionnairewas distributed. The responses indicated that students found the idea appealing and believed it could enhancetheir learning experience. Several suggestions for improvement were also provided, which will be used to refinethe proposed solution in future iterations. Several improvements to the classification mechanism that can enhanceits accuracy and effectiveness were also identified during the process.Conclusion: The findings of this research provide educators, administrators, and policymakers with essentialinformation that can be used to build targeted interventions and support systems for students early in their studies.The findings contribute to the broader discourse on educational strategies, enhancing positive peer interactionsand developing a learning environment that provides support and motivation to all students.},
