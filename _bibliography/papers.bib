  abstract={The process of globalization and the development of new technologies have provided access to enormous amounts of data for processing. The rapid growth of these amounts will not slow down the near future. In fact, recent studies suggest that worldwide data creation will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025. This is ten times the amount of data produced in 2017 (Seagate, 2020). As a consequence of this, a plethora of new challenges in the field of statistics have arisen. In particular, novel mathematical methodologies are continuously being developed as a way to tackle the heterogeneous nature of the collected data. Similarly, distinct data collection procedures are restructured for the purpose of easing the process of data gathering. This growing body of statistical methodologies and collection procedures, in turn, lead to the emergence of the basic issue of provision of privacy in data collection and the establishment of fair methods for data analysis. Data privacy, as a concept, describes the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, legal and political issues surrounding them (Michael, 2013). Fairness, on the other hand, describes the concerns related to data analytics that can cause societal harm by preventing unbiased and consistent interpretation of the patterns within the data (Sokolovska & Kocarev, 2018).},

  title={The short-run impact of COVID-19 on the activity in the insurance industry in the Republic of North Macedonia},
  author={Stojkoski, Viktor and Jolakoski, Petar and Ivanovski, Igor},
  journal={Risk Management and Insurance Review},
  volume={24},
  number={3},
  abstract={Recent studies suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic
will induce drastic changes in the business models of
the insurance industry. However, despite an abundance of predictions, the literature still lacks empirical
investigations of the impact of the pandemic. In this
paper, we perform a first of a kind analysis and investigate the short‐run impact of COVID‐19 on the
activity in the insurance in one country—North Macedonia. By utilizing a seasonal autoregressive model,
we find that during the first half of 2020, the activity in
the insurance industry shrank by more than 10% to
what was expected. The total loss in the industry
amounted to approximately 8.2 million euros. This was
much less than the volume of reserves that the Insurance Supervision Agency made available as funds
for dealing with the potential crisis. In addition, the
pandemic induced changes in the insurance activity
structure—the share of motor vehicles class in the total
industry activity fell at the expense of the property
classes. Our results suggest that the insurance industry
in North Macedonia was well prepared to tackle the
consequences of the pandemic and that automatic
stabilizers had a major influence on weakening the
overall negative impact.},

  abstract={Ever since the dawn of merchanting, traders have sought ways to ease the cost oftransactions. The recent growth of information and communication technology provided awide range of solutions for international and national transactions by introducing e-commerce. As a result of this development, e-commerce recently emerged as a dominanttransaction activity with a significant impact on the national economies. In recent years thepotential of e-commerce has been widely discussed, with a particular focus on its effects ongreater economic welfare and prosperity. Yet, despite an abundance of studies that havebeen done on investigating the role of e-commerce in an economy, a thorough and detailedeconometric examination on its impact is still an underexplored avenue. This paper attemptsto bridge this gap by investigating the impact of volume of online transactions (e-commerce)and gross capital formation on economic growth, using panel data on 31 European countriescovering a 16 years’ period. The empirical panel data model is estimated by employing theGeneralized Method of Moments. The main findings from the study show that e-commerceand gross capital formation have positive and significant effects on GDP per capita basedon purchasing power parity, with e-commerce having a weaker development-enhancingeffect in comparison to gross capital formation. In addition, this paper proposes a fruitfuldiscussion on how to provide balance between the growth of e-commerce, the focus onimproving other aspects and generating optimal economic welfare and prosperity. Ourpaper ends with directions for future research.},
