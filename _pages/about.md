I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering. My work spans economics, statistical physics, and recently machine learning, and over time Iâ€™ve become most interested in physics, especially its connections to machine learning (for example, the development of diffusion models).

Over the years, I became well aware of two things: 1) I don't know A LOT of stuff I want and must know; 2) I know that I can learning anything. I went from an accounting degree to co-authoring papers in statistical physics.
