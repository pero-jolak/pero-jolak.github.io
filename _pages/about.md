I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University - Skopje, Macedonia. My work spans economics, statistical physics, and recently machine learning.

Over the years, I became most interested in physics and became well aware of two things: 1) I don't know A LOT of stuff I want and must know; 2) I know that I can learning anything (I went from an accounting degree to working on problems in statistical physics).

For more information about me, check [my CV](assets/PJ_CV.pdf).

## Main areas of research

### Statistical physics

### Economics

### Machine learning


## Collaborators

I collaborated closely with: Ljupco Kocarev, Trifce Sandev, Viktor Stojkoski, Pece Trajanovski, Arnab Pal, Lasko Basnarkov and Dragan Tevdovski.
I am looking for possible collaborations in groups focusing on physics + AI/ML. I can also contribute to projects related to econophysics.
